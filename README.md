# Punk

I am a child of the 1970s & 1980s.
I grew up associating the word _"punk"_ with
colorful mohawks & spikey hair,
with black leather jackets covered in shiny metal studs,
and
with a genre of loud, fast paced, energetic music utilizing electric guitars and loud drums — known as **punk rock**.

"**Punk**"
—
originally derogatory slang used to call someone an _insignificant, worthless person_, and with negative connotations, sometimes suggesting a person was a _fool_ or a _scoundrel_
—
took an a new meaning due to the _punk rock_ music movement of the 1970s and 1980s.

**Punk** became a word used to mean
—
????.
